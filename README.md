### Hi there, I'm Angad.

I develop 🌏 Web and 📱 Mobile Applications. I have experience with JavaScript, React (& React Native), Python, and more.

- 💻 I'm currently working on the latest iteration of my personal portfolio website - https://angadvirk.github.io/
- 🌱 I'm also refreshing my React Fundamentals and better learning how to work with Firebase for Authentication and Storage.
- 💼 I was most recently a Software Engineering Intern at MakeMyTrip, where I mainly worked on the iOS app's Front End in React Native.
